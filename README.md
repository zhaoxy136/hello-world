# hello-world
Hello,everyone. My name is Barry, since my favorite character is the Flash of DC comics.
I am not a CS student but I love coding.

When I first come to GitHub and first time heard about 'git'...  
--First time I know 'git' ... WAT? Git? you mean.. eh.. bastard?!   
--Absolutely not, bro. It's a version control system used for software development.   
--Still so obscure...   
--Alright, suppose you and your team are working on a project. And you guys want to edit the same file simultanrously.  
What if you spent hours to complete one part but found some little bitch has already delete or change the contents?  
--I wanna kill him/her!  
--So that's when version control comes on stage. In other words, 'git' can help you edits the same file freely without concerning about the influence on others or their's on yours.   
--Wow, that sounds pretty cool!  
--Definitely! And there are more advantages with git. You will find it later. Happy Coding!
